# QuestWeek1
Escape Room - Natalia Labrador (Group Juan Fran, Javier, Natalia)
This is the escape room my team and I created for this week's project.
We created an entire new world where you can enter and start playing to reach the final goal: escape the room.
Here you will encounter the code we implemented with all the definitions and functions that make our game work.
You will also find a PDF file with the presentation we made to show our results.
